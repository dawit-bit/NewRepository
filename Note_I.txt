Some notes on data science:

Data science:

is a multidisciplinary field that study large volumes of data to discern patterns
and reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices 

Tools of data science:

There are two major categories consisting of data and algorithms (models) 

Data tools consist of data management tools: including such functions as store, 
organize, and retrieve data
    - data integration and transformation tools: streamline data pipelines and 
      automate data processing work flows 
    - data visualization tools: graphical representation of data and sharing 
      insights 
    - data asset management tools: organize and manage data, enforce access 
      controls, ensure asset backups, version control etc.

Model
    - code development and execution tools: development, testing and execution 
      environment
    - model deployment, monitoring, and assessment tools
    - code asset management tools, includes access control, versioning, 
      collaboration ...      

Python programming language -xics: A high-level general purpose programming 
language


Clear and easily readable syntax: 
   has strict rules on indentation and accepts only one statement in a line. 
   This characteristics of the language removes the need for separators, such 
   as semicolon between lines or curly brackets between program blocks, and 
   hence it can produces a more concise code      

has large global community and a wealth of documentation 
has a vast library of functions and methods
   - For scientific computing it provides libraries such as Pandas, NumPy,
     SciPy, and MatPlotLib	
   - For AI, it has libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and SciKit-Learn 
open source and hence available free of charge 



Note: 

Python and R are two languages that are widely used in data analysis. While
Python is a general purpose language R is a statistical programming language.
There is software hat can be executed from Micro Soft command line, but also 
there are integrated development environments for the R language, the one 
most commonly used in data science is R studio         


Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are used for interactive data analysis, scientific computing, 
and creating executable documents by combining code, text, and visualizations. 
They are ideal for rapid prototyping, teaching, and developing data-driven 
projects because they allow users to run code in small chunks, immediately 
see the results, and integrate explanatory text, making the entire process 
both interactive and shareable. 

Primary uses of Jupyter Notebooks:

Data Analysis & Visualization: Users can analyze large datasets and generate 
visual outputs like graphs and plots directly within the notebook. 
Executable Documentation: Notebooks allow you to combine explanatory text 
(using Markdown) with code, so others can follow your thought process, see 
how an algorithm works, and even reproduce your results. 

Rapid Prototyping: You can quickly test and iterate on small pieces of 
code without re-executing the entire program, which is especially useful 
for complex or slow operations. 

Education & Tutorials: The ability to explain concepts with text and show 
results in between code blocks makes notebooks an excellent tool for 
teaching programming and data science. 

Research & Exploration: Scientists and researchers can use notebooks to 
explore data, conduct experiments, and present their findings in a clear, 
integrated format. 

Sharing Work: Notebooks can be easily shared via platforms like GitHub, 
allowing others to view, run, and even modify your code and analyses. 

Integrated Development: For data scientists, notebooks serve as a "data 
scientist dev tool" to build parts of more complex applications by 
developing, testing, and refining code before moving it to 
production-ready scripts. 


Jupiter provides access to Python and R programming languages, scripted 
form ...

The most widely used online distributor of Jupyter is Anaconda.
